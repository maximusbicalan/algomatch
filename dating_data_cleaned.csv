You will also find people whose whole life's goal is to play with your feelings and make you feel bad about yourself. From my experience, there are genuinely a lot of bad people in dating apps. All I can say is to not lose hope; love comes unexpectedly. You could encounter it in a myriad of ways that are not limited to a dating app, but finding that love will take a lot of time, even years, and that requires a lot of patience. While finding a person that gives a sense of security is a comforting feeling, you must not forget that feeling is not strictly tied to relationships. You can get that kind of feeling from your family members, your friends, and even yourself :^)."
